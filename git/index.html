<h2>What Is Git?</h2>
<p>Git is a very easy way for a lot of people to work on the same files at once without conflict and with a detailed history of all changes. Its designed to let multiple
    developers work on separate features of the same project simultaneously. Git is organized into a hierarchy of <strong>repositories</strong> (individual coding
    projects) and <strong>branches</strong> (separate versions of the same project). A similar example of this concept would be Microsoft’s SharePoint software.
</p>
<p>The workflow is relatively simple: first, you <strong>clone</strong> the remote repository from a Git server (for instance GitHub), which makes a local copy of all the
    files and version history on your own computer. Then, you make the changes you want to make to your local copy, and wrap up all your changes into a packaged
    difference file called a <strong>commit</strong>, to which you can attach a message describing what you’ve changed. Once you’ve made one (or several) commits, you can
    then <strong>push</strong> all the commits to GitHub, which is when your changes travel back to the remote repository and are applied for everyone to see. Git will
    automatically resolve most conflicts with changes that other people have made in the meantime, even multiple changes to the same file.
</p>
<p>Repositories can have different <strong>branches</strong>. Branches are parallel instances of the code, used to keep track of separate issues or features. Each branch
    is made up of a distinct set of changes from the master files, all related to the specific feature that the branch represents. In Git, you <strong>checkout</strong> a
    branch to switch your local files to its specific changes. Once these issues or features are implemented, branches can be <strong>merged</strong> back together,
    folding all the changes made since they were split and combining their files. Common convention when working with Git is to have a <strong>master</strong> branch, the
    current stable codebase for the users, a <strong>develop</strong> branch, for all the newly developed changes or features that haven’t been fully tested yet, and a
    multitude of other branches for individual features where all the actual work is done.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Install the
    <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop application</a>
    , then read the steps below. GitHub Desktop installs a GUI (graphical user interface) for using Git, as well as a command line interface, implementing Bash on
    Windows, for more traditional Git use. Below each step is a code box with the relevant command. It is not necessary to know or use these commands if you use the GUI,
    but it helps to understand the traditional Git interface in case you need to perform more advanced Git actions like conflict resolution or rebasing.

<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Clone</strong> a repository to your local workspace (make sure to specify your desired workspace location on your computer).</p>
        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/UMDBPP/PacketRaven.git /path/to/your/workspace/</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Get to know the <strong>branch</strong>es for the repository you just cloned, and figure out which one you want to work on.</p>
        <pre><code>git branch -a</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Checkout</strong> the branch you want to work on (this switches your local files to that branch).</p>
        <pre><code>git checkout branch-name</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>After you make your changes (using your editor or IDE of choice), check the <strong>status</strong> of your changed files, and make sure you haven’t made any
            unintended changes.
        </p>
        <pre><code>git status</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Commit</strong> your changes (wrap them up into an easy delta) with a descriptive message.</p>
        <pre><code>git commit -a -m &quot;Here is a description of what I changed&quot;</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Pull</strong> any changes or new branches other people have made and then <strong>push</strong> your own changes to GitHub (these are combined into the
            Sync button in the GUI). Make sure you are on the right branch or you may make unintentional changes to someone else’s work!
        </p>
        <pre><code>git pull &amp;&amp; git push</code></pre>
    </li>
